# ðŸ“ˆ stonky asynchronous version!!! (experimental)

## Blazingly fast! Support for cryptocurrencies! Stock name alias support!
I've tinkered stonky a little bit to improve speed. Gevent modules make it possible for synchronous python codes to execute asynchronously.   

## How to install(for ubuntu)

```
sudo apt install python3.7-dev (or python3.8-dev)
git clone https://github.com/HeavensGold/stonky.git  
cd stonky
python3.7(or python3.8) -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## How to run(for ubuntu)
```
python3.7 main.py
```

## How to install(for android phone)

You need to install termux(a terminal emulator for android) from GooglePlay or from F-droid.
From termux command line window,

```
pkg install clang python git
git clone https://github.com/HeavensGold/stonky.git
cd stonky
pip install -r requiremnets.txt  ##installing gevent module on the phone takes a looooot of time. be patient:)
```

## How to run(for android phone)
```
python main.py
```
termux installs python3.8 as default.


## How to configure
There is '.stonky.cfg' file on the stonky main directory.
Edit the file with text editors to add or remove tickers and positions.

```
# An example config file for stonky

[watchlist]
# Include this section to show the watchlist report
AAPL
005930.KS: SamsungE
035420.KS: Naver
AMD
INTC
AMZN
NFLX
DIS
GOOGL
NVDA
BTC-USD
ETH-USD
ETC-USD
LTC-USD
XMR-USD
DASH-USD

[positions]
# Used to calculate the balance and profit and loss reports
AMZN=5
#VGRO.TO=1000  ; international exchanges are supported
BTC-USD: 0.1   ; cryptocurrencies are supported

[cash]
# These amounts just get added to the balance report
USD=15000
#AUD=100,000  ; you can seperate large numbers using commas

[preferences]
# You can also set or override these values using command line arguments
currency=  ; if set will convert all amounts using current forex rates
refresh=   ; if set automatically reloads reports for given number of seconds
sort='delta_percent'      ; can use ticket, bid, ask, low, high, close, change, or volume

```

# ðŸ“ˆ stonky(original)

stonky is a simple command line dashboard for monitoring stocks. It pulls live data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) so anything it can support, e.g. international exchanges, crypocurrencies, etc., stonky can too.

## Install

`$ pip3 install --user stonky`

## Config

stonky is mainly configured through a config file. By default it looks for and loads a file named **`.stonky.cfg`** in your home directory. You can also specify a custom path by passing the `--config=<PATH>` command line argument which can be useful to monitor multiple watchlists. If you run stonky without a config file it will load [the example one](https://github.com/jkwill87/stonky/blob/master/stonky/__example.cfg) by default.

## Arguments

You can also set or override many of stonky's settings via command-line arguments.

```
usage: stonky [-h] [--config PATH] [--currency CODE] [--refresh SECONDS] [--sort FIELD]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --config PATH      sets path to config file
  --currency CODE    converts all amounts using current forex rates
  --refresh SECONDS  refreshes output on set interval
  --sort FIELD       orders stocks by field

FIELDS can be one of ticket, bid, ask, low, high, close, change, volume
```
